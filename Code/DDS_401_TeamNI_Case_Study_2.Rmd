<center> <h1>Career Attrition Analysis for DDS Talent Management</h1> </center>
<center> <h1>NaturalIntelligence Analytics</h1> </center>

NaturalIntelligence Analytics would like to thank DDS Talent Management for the opportunity to explore job attrition data! The codebook below is intended to load, clean, and explore the data supplied to us for the purpose of discovering the top 3 factors that lead to attrition. Let's get started!

##Let's set up our environment and load the data!

```{r 1}
suppressMessages(library(randomForest))
suppressMessages(library(randomForestExplainer))
suppressMessages(library(pscl))
suppressMessages(library(RCurl))
suppressMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressMessages(library(nnet))
suppressMessages(library(kableExtra))
suppressMessages(library(broom))
jobURL <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjwolfe91/DDS_401_TeamNI_Case_Study2/master/Data/CaseStudy2-data.csv")
jobDF <- read.csv(text=jobURL, header=TRUE)
kable(head(jobDF), format = "html", align = "c") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

##Hmmm, looks like there's a little cleanup to do...let's stratify some of the variables

```{r 2}
str(jobDF)
jobDF$AgeGroup <- cut(jobDF$X.U.FEFF.Age, c(-Inf, 20, 29, 39, 49, 59, Inf))
levels(jobDF$AgeGroup) <- c("<20", "20-29", "30-39", "40-49", "50-59", "60+")
jobDF$GenderInd <- 0
jobDF[jobDF$Gender == "Male", ]$GenderInd <- 1
drops <- c("X.U.FEFF.Age","Gender")
jobDF <- jobDF[ , !(names(jobDF) %in% drops)]
```
##Not sure where to begin...so let's test them all!

Since we are looking for the top 3 variables out of several possibilities, we will use a machine learning technique known as a random forest. A random forest is a panel of decision trees designed to test several permutations of variable interactions to see which variables seem to have the most influence on a particular outcome. This makes it a powerful technique in exploration. The first step is to build a training set & test set. The training set is 70% of the data, while the test set is 30%.

```{r 3}
set.seed(26)
train <- sample(nrow(jobDF),0.7*nrow(jobDF), replace = FALSE)
jobDF.train <- jobDF[train,]
jobDF.test <- jobDF[-train,]
jobs.rf <- randomForest(Attrition ~ ., data=jobDF.train, importance=TRUE)
print(jobs.rf)
```
##Identify the optimal mtry

```{r 4}
a=c()
i=5
for (i in 3:34) {
  jobs.rf2<-randomForest(Attrition ~.,data = jobDF.train, ntree=500, mtry=i, importance=TRUE)
  pred_test_jobs<-predict(jobs.rf2,jobDF.test,type ="class")
  a[i-2]=mean(pred_test_jobs==jobDF.test$Attrition)
}
plot(3:34,a,pch=19,col="steel blue",type = "o",xlab = "mtry itteration", ylab = "Accuracy %",main = "Model optimization")
```

##Looks like 24 mtry's generates the most accurate model

```{r 5}
jobs.rf3 <- randomForest(Attrition ~ ., data=jobDF.train, ntree=500, importance=TRUE, mtry=24)
print(jobs.rf3)
```

##Let's predict!

```{r 6}
jobRFPred <-predict(jobs.rf3,jobDF.test,type = "class")
mean(pred_test_jobs==jobDF.test$Attrition)
kable(table(pred_test_jobs,jobDF.test$Attrition), format = "html", align = "c") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

##Prediction test supports the accuracy we found earlier. Let's use this to pick our top 3 variables.

```{r 7}
importanceDF <- data.frame(round(importance(jobs.rf3),2))
sortYes <- importanceDF[order(importanceDF$Yes,decreasing = TRUE),]
kable(sortYes, format = "html", align = "c") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

According to our random forest analysis, the top 3 factors that contribute to attrition are Overtime, Monthly Income, and Environment Satisfaction, with ~84% accuracy.

##Let's take a look at a more detailed breakdown

```{r 8}
#explain_forest(jobs.rf3, data=jobDF)
```

##Let's plot importance for each variable

```{r 9}
varImpPlot(jobs.rf3, main="Importance of Job Variables in Attrition", n.var=15)
```

It seems clear that the 3 factors we highlighted earlier are our best bet, according to this algorithm. Let's test!

##Now that we have the top 3, let's test the model!

Since this is a model with a binary response (someone will attrite or they will not), we will test a logistic regression model. It's important to recognize that this model predicts if the included variables will have an impact (either way) on the attrition outcome, not that they are entirely predictive of positive attrition.

```{r 10}
jobs.glm <- glm(Attrition ~ MonthlyIncome + EnvironmentSatisfaction + OverTime, data=jobDF, family=binomial(link='logit'))
kable(tidy(jobs.glm), format = "html", align = "c") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
kable(pR2(jobs.glm), format = "html", align = "c") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

In a linear regression model, the adjusted R-Squared is the most broadly accepted statistic for "accuracy." In logistic regression, the closest equivalent is the McFadden log likelihood. In this case, the model with the above parameters produces 11.9% McFadden score - indicating that this model contributes to roughly 11.9% of the variance in attrition outcomes.

##Other observations

Our random forest algorithm has also postulated the top factors that contribution to a person remaining in their job. Let's go through a similar exercise:

```{r 11}
sortNo <- importanceDF[order(importanceDF$No,decreasing = TRUE),]
kable(sortNo, format = "html", align = "c") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

It looks like some of the same factors that lead to attrition can also contribute to someone remaining in their current role. Let's adjust the model for a "No" response assumption:

```{r 12}
jobsNo.glm <- glm(Attrition ~ MonthlyIncome + TotalWorkingYears + OverTime, data=jobDF, family=binomial(link='logit'))
kable(tidy(jobsNo.glm), format = "html", align = "c") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
kable(pR2(jobsNo.glm), format = "html", align = "c") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

This produces a McFadden score of 10.8%.

##Conclusion

While on the surface, it appears the variables we selected using the random forest do not have that large of an impact, this does not mean they are not accurate. There are almost 20 possible variables and many different permutations therein, meaning true "accuracy" cannot be measured without training and testing the model. The next steps would be to obtain more data.
