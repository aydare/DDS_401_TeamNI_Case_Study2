# DDS_401_TeamNI_Case_Study2
This repository contains code written to explore and resolve Case Study #2 for the 401 (Winter 2018) term of the Doing Data Science course at Southern Methodist University’s Master’s of Science in Data Science. The purpose of this case study is to help a talent management firm study attrition rates for various career fields; more specifically, we will determine the top 3 (or more) variables that contribute to high turnover. We will also determine any other interesting trends we find in the data. We will accomplish this using exploratory data analysis and various machine learning algorithms using R, then publish the results using MarkDown. Contributors include Michael J. Wolfe, Ruben Chavez, and Ayoade Dare. Please reach out to one of us with any questions, comments, or feedback.
